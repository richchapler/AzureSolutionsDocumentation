You run this query on SQL Server in an Azure Virtual Machine: 
```sql
SELECT SalesPersonID, SUM(SubTotal), SUM(TotalDue) 
FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader 
WHERE SalesPersonID = 1; 
``` 

The actual execution plan first performs a nonclustered index seek on `SalesOrderHeader.SalesOrderID`, then uses a Key Lookup against the clustered primary-key index `PK_SalesOrderHeader_SalesOrderID` to retrieve the `SubTotal` and `TotalDue` columns. You consider forcing this exact plan.

Will forcing the plan reduce I/O usage and overall query execution time? 
<br>A) Yes 
<br>B) No 

### Question 31
You create a new nonclustered index on `SalesOrderHeader`: 
```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_SOH_SPID_SubTotal_TotalDue 
 ON Sales.SalesOrderHeader (SalesPersonID) 
 INCLUDE (SubTotal, TotalDue); 
``` 
Without forcing a plan, the optimizer will seek this index directly and eliminate the Key Lookup. Compared to the existing plan (Index Seek + Key Lookup), will this new index increase I/O usage and execution time? 
<br>A) Yes 
<br>B) No 

### Question 32
Instead of adding a separate index, you modify the clustered primary-key index `PK_SalesOrderHeader_SalesOrderID` to include the `SubTotal`, `TaxAmt`, and `Freight` columns as non-key included columns: 
```sql
ALTER INDEX PK_SalesOrderHeader_SalesOrderID 
 ON Sales.SalesOrderHeader 
 REBUILD WITH (INCLUDE = (SubTotal, TaxAmt, Freight)); 
``` 
After this change, the optimizer can satisfy the query entirely from the clustered index without any lookups. Will this modification reduce I/O usage and query execution time compared to the original plan? 
<br>A) Yes 
<br>B) No 

### Question 33
A human-resources team has an Employee table with these column definitions and requirements: 
- LastHireDate is stored as a `DATETIME` 
- Salary is stored as a `VARCHAR(20)` 
- PhoneNumber is stored as a `VARCHAR(30)` 
All hire dates only need a date (no time), salaries are fixed-point monetary values, and phone numbers consist of digits only (no formatting beyond hyphens).

Which two recommendations will reduce storage and improve performance? 
<br>A) Change Salary to the `money` data type 
<br>B) Change PhoneNumber to `float` 
<br>C) Change LastHireDate to `datetime2(7)`

Which action ensures the query always uses the faster plan? 
<br>A) Force Plan 1221065 
<br>B) Run DBCC FREEPROCCACHE to clear the cache
