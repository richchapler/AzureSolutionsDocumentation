1. **Install IntelliJ IDEA**: You can download it from the official JetBrains website (Download IntelliJ IDEA – The Leading Java and Kotlin IDE (jetbrains.com)). Choose the version that suits your needs (Community or Ultimate). After downloading, install it following the instructions.    
  
2. **Install Java on your system**:  
   1. Download Java JDK: Go to the Oracle website (for Java 11) or AdoptOpenJDK (for other versions). Download the appropriate JDK for your operating system.  
   2. Install Java JDK: Run the installer and follow the instructions to install the JDK on your system.  
   
3. **Set JAVA_HOME on Windows**:  
   1. Right-click on My Computer or This PC and select Properties.  
   2. Click on Advanced system settings.  
   3. In the System Properties window that opens, go to the Advanced tab and click on Environment Variables.  
   4. In the Environment Variables window, under System variables, click New.  
   5. In the New System Variable window, enter JAVA_HOME as the variable name and “C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-22” as the variable value (NO TRAILING WHACK and DOUBLE QUOTES ARE IMPORTANT)  
   6. Click OK in all windows to apply the changes.  
   
4. **Test by entering this directly in a command line**: "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-22\bin\java" -version  
   
5. **To add the JDK to your Path, follow these steps**:  
   1. Press Win + X and choose System.  
   2. Click on Advanced system settings.  
   3. In the System Properties window that appears, click on Environment Variables.  
   4. In the Environment Variables window, under System variables, find and select the Path variable, then click on Edit.  
   5. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click on New.  
   6. Type %JAVA_HOME%\bin and press Enter.  
   7. Click OK in all windows to apply the changes.  
   
6. **Install Maven and add it to your PATH**:  
   1. Download Maven: You can download Maven from the official Apache Maven website. Choose the binary zip archive (apache-maven-3.x.x-bin.zip).  
   2. Extract the zip file: Once the download is complete, extract the zip file to a directory on your system. For example, you might extract it to C:\Program Files\Apache\Maven.  
   3. Add Maven to your PATH:  
      1. On Windows:  
         1. Search for "Environment Variables" in your start menu and select "Edit the system environment variables".  
         2. In the System Properties window that appears, click on "Environment Variables".  
         3. In the Environment Variables window, under "System variables", find the Path variable, select it, and click on "Edit".  
         4. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click on "New", and then add the path to the bin directory of your Maven installation. For example, if you extracted Maven to C:\Program Files\Apache\maven, you would add C:\Program Files\Apache\maven\bin.  
         5. Click "OK" in each window to close them.  
   
7. **Install Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ**: This toolkit allows you to develop, run, and debug Azure applications directly from IntelliJ IDEA.  
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA.  
   - Go to `File -> Settings -> Plugins`.  
   - In the search bar, type `Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ` and click on the search result.  
   - Click on `Install` and wait for the installation to complete.  
   - Restart IntelliJ IDEA to complete the installation.  
   
8. **Create a new Azure Functions project**: Azure Functions is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs.  
   - In IntelliJ IDEA, click on `File -> New -> Project`.  
   - In the new window, select `Azure Functions` under `Azure` on the left panel.  
   - Choose your project SDK (Software Development Kit). If you have installed the JDK as per the previous steps, it should appear in the dropdown menu.  
   - Click `Next`.  
   - Enter your project name and choose a location on your system where the project files will be stored.  
   - Click `Finish` to create the project.  
   
9. **Write your function code**: Now, you'll write the code for your Azure Function.  
   - In the `Project` window, navigate to `src/main/java/<YourPackageName>`.  
   - Right-click on the package and select `New -> Azure Function`.  
   - In the new window, enter the function name and choose the trigger type (for example, HttpTrigger). The trigger determines how your function is invoked. An HttpTrigger means your function will run whenever it receives an HTTP request.  
   - Click `OK` to create the function. IntelliJ IDEA will generate a function class with a method that gets called when your function is triggered.  
   
10. **Test your function locally**: Before deploying your function to Azure, you should test it locally to make sure it works correctly.  
   - Right-click on your project and select `Run -> Functions: host start`.  
   - IntelliJ IDEA will start the Azure Functions runtime and your function will be ready to test locally.  
   
11. **Deploy your function to Azure**: Once you're satisfied with your function, you can deploy it to Azure to make it publicly accessible.  
   - Right-click on your project and select `Deploy -> Deploy to Azure`.  
   - In the new window, sign in to your Azure account. If you don't have one, you'll need to create one.  
   - Select your subscription, and choose or create a new Function App. The Function App is a way to organize and collectively manage your functions.  
   - Click `Run` to deploy your function to Azure.  
   
Remember, you need to have an active Azure subscription to deploy your function to Azure. If you don't have one, you can create a free account.
