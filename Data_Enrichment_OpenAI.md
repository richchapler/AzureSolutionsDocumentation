# Data Enrichment: Azure OpenAI

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44923999/227210296-1540091a-e156-41d9-9cfd-278246c311f1.png" width="1000" />

## Use Case
This solution considers the following requirements:

* "I want to learn about Azure OpenAI with a simple use case"
* "I want to enrich data with compelling content ready for consumption by end-users"

## Required Infrastructure
This solution requires the following resources:

* [**Data Explorer**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/) [cluster](Infrastructure_DataExplorer_Cluster.md), [database](Infrastructure_DataExplorer_Database.md), and [sample data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/ingest-sample-data?tabs=ingestion-wizard)
  * Grant "Owner" IAC permissions and "**Database User**" permissions for the Synapse System-Assigned Managed Identity
* [**OpenAI**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview) with [deployment model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal)
* [**Postman**](https://www.postman.com/product/workspaces/) with Postman's Desktop Agent, a workspace, and a collection
* [**Synapse**](Infrastructure_Synapse.md)

## Proposed Solution

Concept: Enrich Data Explorer's sample dataset, "StormEvents" with cost data for similar, recent events.<br>
_{i.e., "these three similar storm events had X damages that cost $Y to repair"}_

This documentation will address solution requirements in two exercises:

* Exercise 1: Prepare Prompt
* Exercise 2: Create Data Flow

-----

## Exercise 1: Prepare Prompt
In this exercise, we will iteratively generate a prompt that can be used with an OpenAI ChatGPT model.

Navigate to your Postman workspace and collection,<br>
_{e.g., https://web.postman.co/workspace/My-Workspace~00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}_

Click "+" to open a new tab and rename to "OpenAI_ChatGPT".
Enter the following values:

Prompt | Entry
:----- | :-----
**HTTP Method** | Select "**POST**"
**Enter URL or paste text** | Modify and paste:<br>`https://{SERVICE_NAME}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{MODEL_NAME}/completions?api-version=2022-12-01`

Navigate to the "**Headers**" tab.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44923999/233663772-477594b2-9292-44a8-b30d-1b2c368f5660.png" width="800" title="Snipped: April 21, 2023" />

Enter the following values:

Key | Value
:----- | :-----
**api-key** | {OPENAI_KEY}
**Content-Type** | application/json

Now we begin crafting our request...

### Attempt #1, Basic Request

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44923999/233670102-d699c733-74c7-4963-b019-d9bbeb42edd3.png" width="800" title="Snipped: April 21, 2023" />

Navigate to the "**Body**" tab and paste the following JSON:

```
{
    "prompt":"storm events",
    "max_tokens":1000,
    "temperature":0.10
}
```

Logic Explained:
* `prompt`... the query for which to generate a completion; our strategy will be to start with something very simple and hone in later steps
* `max_tokens`... establishes context length
* `temperature`... closer to 0 for greater accuracy and closer to 1 for more creativity

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44923999/233673117-9bf1f55c-3981-4429-b330-23bbdf775602.png" width="800" title="Snipped: April 21, 2023" />

Click "**Send**". You can expect a response like this:

```
{
    "id": "cmpl-77mmEhk08ghAN7eGRqsYMu8UtBPBb",
    "object": "text_completion",
    "created": 1682090150,
    "model": "gpt-35-turbo",
    "choices": [
        {
            "text": ". The results of this study can be used to inform the design of future studies and to provide guidance for the development of more effective stormwater management strategies.\n\nKeywords: urbanization, stormwater, hydrology, water quality, land use, modeling, watershed, runoff, water resources, water management\n\nProcedia PDF Downloads 1 \n\n- ‹\n- 1\n- 2\n- ›",
            "index": 0,
            "finish_reason": "stop",
            "logprobs": null
        }
    ],
    "usage": {
        "completion_tokens": 82,
        "prompt_tokens": 2,
        "total_tokens": 84
    }
}
```

This start is a good test of the API, but not very specific to the concept.<br>
We need to develop our understanding of source data that we might use to enhance our prompt.

### Attempt #2, Parameter Preparation

Navigate to your Data Explorer database, then Query in the navigation pane.
Enter `StormEvents | take 1` and then click "**Run**".<br>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44923999/227569221-98668b58-0089-4884-bfec-ff762b17b52c.png" width="800" title="Snipped: March 24, 2023" />

A quick review of the data provides some interesting options:

Column | Data
:----- | :-----
**Start Time** | 2007-01-01T00:00:00Z
**State** | NORTH CAROLINA
**Event Type** | Thunderstorm Wind

With this sort of data we might develop a prompt like:

`List three recent examples of NORTH CAROLINA storm events similar to the Thunderstorm Wind storm event that began 2007-01-01T00:00:00Z`

Return to Postman, navigate to the "**Body**" tab, update the "**prompt**" value in the JSON and click "**Send**".

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44923999/233674508-b1481b5b-301c-4726-b377-9d9bfeba80d6.png" width="800" title="Snipped: March 24, 2023" />

This time, the response is more specific and informative.

            "index": 0,

        "prompt_tokens": 35,
        "total_tokens": 1035
    }
}
```

The response lacks cost data (which we need for the original concept), so let's try again...

### Attempt #3, Concept Alignment

Expand the prompt to include cost and contributors:

`List three recent examples of NORTH CAROLINA storm events similar to the Thunderstorm Wind storm event that began 2007-01-01T00:00:00Z.
Include the cost of each example along with cost contributors.`

Return to Postman, navigate to the "**Body**" tab, update the "**prompt**" value in the JSON and click "**Send**".

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44923999/233679085-c35cba03-e145-4f35-8721-f9c0ee8d0b19.png" width="800" title="Snipped: April 21, 2023" />

Now the response includes cost information.

Some challenges, though:
* The results include different events than Attempt #2
* Results seem more extreme {e.g., Hurricane Florence costing $24b vs. "Thunderstorm Wind"}
* Factors seem very generic

Prompt iteration can go on and on, but we have done enough for this exercise.

## Exercise 2: Create Pipeline
In this exercise, we will bake our prompt into a Synapse Pipeline, parameterize from Data Explorer, StormEvents sample data and insert the result into a sink dataset.

### Step 1: Prepare Destination

Navigate to your Data Explorer Database, and then "**Query**" in the "**Overview**" grouping of the left-hand navigation pane.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44923999/233708563-cf1fab61-8008-4cbd-bda3-8dc5038c4fad.png" width="800" title="Snipped: April 21, 2023" />

**Run** the following script.
```
.create table StormEvents_Enriched (EventId: long, State: string, EventType: string, Comparable: string)
```

### Step 2: Create Pipeline
Open Synapse Studio, and then the "**Integrate**" icon in the left-hand navigation bar.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44923999/233680690-cd720438-092a-4a8e-938a-e9a4b09df3f7.png" width="800" title="Snipped: April 21, 2023" />

Click the "**+**" icon and then "**Pipeline**" in the resulting dropdown menu.

#### Lookup Activity
Drag-and-drop a "**Lookup**" component from the "**Activities**" tree, "**General**" grouping.

**Run** the following script.

```
StormEvents_Enriched
```

You should see three rows, with "**Comparables**" column populated from Azure OpenAI.
