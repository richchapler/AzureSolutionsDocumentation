# How to secure Fabric Warehouse from top to bottom

## Warehouse

Click "+ Add user" and complete the resulting pop-up form:
* Select user(s) or group(s)

## User
_Documentation, Oct 2023: `CREATE USER` cannot be explicitly executed currently. When GRANT or DENY is executed, the user is created automatically. The user will not be able to connect until sufficient workspace level rights are given._

### View My Permissions
[SQL granular permissions in Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/sql-granular-permissions)

Execute the following logic to see granular permissions granted to you:
```
SELECT * FROM sys.fn_my_permissions(NULL, 'Database');
```

## Schema

Start by creating a schema that we can use for demonstration:

```
CREATE SCHEMA [rchaplerfwh-s];
```

### Permissions

To grant permissions to an individual user, personalize / execute the following logic:
```
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA::[rchaplerfwh-s] TO [brsoltis@microsoft.com]
```

To grant permissions to a group, you must share the warehouse with the group and then personalize / execute the following logic:
```
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA::[rchaplerfwh-s] TO [rchaplerg]
```

_Note: this logic is pending verification_

-----

## Table

Start by creating a table that we can use for demonstration:

```
CREATE TABLE [rchaplerfwh-t] (c1 INT, c2 VARCHAR(32));
```

### Permissions

To grant permissions to an individual user, personalize / execute the following logic:
```
GRANT SELECT ON [rchaplerfwh-t] TO [brsoltis@microsoft.com]
```

## Row-Level
_Documentation, Oct 2023: Row-level security is currently not supported. Dynamic data masking is currently not supported._
