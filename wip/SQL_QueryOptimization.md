## # Query-Specific Changes

### 1. Materialized/Indexed Views 
- **Why:** 
 Materialized views store the precomputed results of complex joins and aggregations, so repeated queries retrieve stored data rather than recalculating heavy operations.
- **Before:** 
 ```sql
 CREATE VIEW [Schema].[View_Generic] AS
 SELECT
 -- Complex SELECT with multiple joins and calculations
 FROM Table1 AS A
 -- Other joins and subqueries...
 ```
- **After:** 
 ```sql
 CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW [Schema].[MV_Generic]
 WITH (CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX) AS
 SELECT
 -- Same complex SELECT with multiple joins and calculations
 FROM Table1 AS A
 -- Other joins and subqueries...
 ```
- **Explanation:** 
 Precomputing and storing the results drastically reduces query time for frequently executed queries.
- **Expected Impact:** **Extra Large**

---

### 2. Eliminate Non-SARGable Operations in Joins 
- **Why:** 
 Non-SARGable operations prevent the query optimizer from efficiently using indexes. For example, applying a function on a column in a join condition forces the system to calculate it for every row.
- **Before:** 
 ```sql
 LEFT OUTER JOIN Table2 AS B 
 ON B.ColumnA = RIGHT(A.ColumnX, 12)
 ```
- **After:** 
 First, add a computed, persisted column and index it:
 ```sql
 ALTER TABLE Table1
 ADD ColumnX_Right12 AS RIGHT(ColumnX, 12) PERSISTED;
 
 CREATE INDEX IX_Table1_ColumnX_Right12 
 ON Table1(ColumnX_Right12);
 ```
 Then update the join:
 ```sql
 LEFT OUTER JOIN Table2 AS B 
 ON B.ColumnA = A.ColumnX_Right12
 ```
- **Explanation:** 
 Precomputing the function result makes the join SARGableâ€”meaning the optimizer can use an index, thereby avoiding a full table scan.
- **Expected Impact:** **Large**

---

### 3. Optimize Subqueries and Aggregations Using CTEs 
- **Why:** 
 Complex subqueries written inline (using DISTINCT, GROUP BY, HAVING) can be expensive. Converting these to Common Table Expressions (CTEs) clarifies logic and may help the optimizer create a more efficient plan.
- **Before:**
 ```sql
 LEFT OUTER JOIN (
 SELECT DISTINCT ColumnY, ColumnZ,
 MAX(CASE WHEN Condition = 'X' THEN 'X' ELSE NULL END) AS Flag1,
 MAX(CASE WHEN Condition = 'Y' THEN 'Y' ELSE NULL END) AS Flag2
 FROM Table3
 GROUP BY ColumnY, ColumnZ
 HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN Condition = 'X' THEN 'X' END) IS NOT NULL
 OR MAX(CASE WHEN Condition = 'Y' THEN 'Y' END) IS NOT NULL
 ) AS CTE_Sub
 ON A.ColumnID = CTE_Sub.ColumnZ
 ```
- **After:**
 ```sql
 ;WITH CTE_Sub AS (
 SELECT ColumnY, ColumnZ,
 MAX(CASE WHEN Condition = 'X' THEN 'X' ELSE NULL END) AS Flag1,
 MAX(CASE WHEN Condition = 'Y' THEN 'Y' ELSE NULL END) AS Flag2
 FROM Table3
 GROUP BY ColumnY, ColumnZ
 HAVING MAX(CASE WHEN Condition = 'X' THEN 'X' END) IS NOT NULL
 OR MAX(CASE WHEN Condition = 'Y' THEN 'Y' END) IS NOT NULL
 )
 ...
 LEFT OUTER JOIN CTE_Sub 
 ON A.ColumnID = CTE_Sub.ColumnZ
 ```
- **Explanation:** 
 Isolating heavy aggregations in a CTE can simplify the main query and help the optimizer reuse computed results.
- **Expected Impact:** **Medium**

---

### 4. Review Join Types and Their Order 
- **Why:** 
 When possible, converting LEFT JOINs to INNER JOINs and reordering joins lets the optimizer filter data earlier, thereby reducing intermediate result sizes.
- **Before:**
 ```sql
 LEFT OUTER JOIN Table4 AS C 
 ON C.Column1 = A.ColumnID
 AND C.Column2 = 'SomeValue'
 ```
- **After (if an INNER JOIN is acceptable):**
 ```sql
 INNER JOIN Table4 AS C 
 ON C.Column1 = A.ColumnID
 AND C.Column2 = 'SomeValue'
 ```
- **Explanation:** 
 INNER JOINs allow more flexible reordering, which can lead to fewer rows being processed in subsequent operations.
- **Expected Impact:** **Medium**

---

### 5. Use WITH (NOLOCK) Hints Where Appropriate 
- **Why:** 
 Adding the `WITH (NOLOCK)` hint allows the query to read data without waiting for locks to be released, reducing blocking in high-concurrency situations. However, this can lead to dirty reads.
- **Before:**
 ```sql
 FROM Table1 AS A
 LEFT OUTER JOIN Table4 AS C 
 ON C.Column1 = A.ColumnID
 ```
- **After:**
 ```sql
 FROM Table1 AS A WITH (NOLOCK)
 LEFT OUTER JOIN Table4 AS C WITH (NOLOCK)
 ON C.Column1 = A.ColumnID
 ```
- **Explanation:** 
 Use NOLOCK when occasional stale data is acceptable in order to reduce waiting times.
- **Expected Impact:** **Small to Medium**

---

### 6. Minimize On-the-Fly Data Conversions and String Operations 
- **Why:** 
 Performing functions like converting data types or extracting substrings on each row increases CPU usage. Precomputing these values minimizes the workload during query execution.
- **Before:**
 ```sql
 CONVERT(date, A.ColumnY, 112) AS "DateConverted"
 ```
- **After:** 
 Create a computed, persisted column:
 ```sql
 ALTER TABLE Table1
 ADD DateConverted AS CONVERT(date, ColumnY, 112) PERSISTED;
 ```
 Then update the query:
 ```sql
 DateConverted AS "DateConverted"
 ```
- **Explanation:** 
 Precomputing conversions reduces per-row overhead and improves overall performance.
- **Expected Impact:** **Small**

---

## # General Changes (for This Query and Others Like It)

### 1. Optimize Data Distribution and Partitioning 
- **Why:** 
 Correct data distribution minimizes expensive data shuffling across compute nodes, while partitioning allows the engine to scan only relevant portions of data (partition elimination).
- **Action:** 
 - **Distribution:** Use hash distribution on large tables based on frequently joined keys; use replicate distribution for small reference tables. 
 - **Partitioning:** Partition large fact tables (e.g., by date) so that queries only scan needed partitions.
- **Expected Impact:** **Large**

---

### 2. Adopt Incremental (Differential) Loading 
- **Why:** 
 Incremental loads update only new or changed data instead of truncating and reloading entire tables, reducing ETL time and preserving indexes/statistics.
- **Action:** 
 Implement change data capture (CDC) or a high-water mark strategy to detect and load only delta changes.
- **Expected Impact:** **Large**

---

### 3. Leverage Result Set Caching 
- **Why:** 
 Caching the results of frequently executed queries can dramatically cut execution time and reduce load on compute resources.
- **Action:** 
 Enable result set caching at the database level for queries that are run repeatedly with the same parameters.
- **Expected Impact:** **Large**

---

### 4. Maintain Clustered Columnstore Indexes and Statistics 
- **Why:** 
 Healthy indexes and up-to-date statistics allow the query optimizer to generate efficient plans, ensuring fast query execution.
- **Action:** 
 Regularly rebuild or reorganize columnstore indexes and update statistics after major data loads.
- **Expected Impact:** **Large**

---

### 5. Rewrite Expressions for SARGability 
- **Why:** 
 SARGable predicates allow the optimizer to use indexes effectively. Avoiding functions on columns in WHERE or JOIN conditions prevents full table scans.
- **Action:** 
 Rewrite filters to compare raw columns or precomputed columns rather than applying functions directly in the query.
- **Expected Impact:** **Medium**

---

### 6. Implement Advanced Monitoring and Diagnostics 
- **Why:** 
 Continuous monitoring with DMVs and execution plan analysis helps you detect bottlenecks and validate performance improvements.
- **Action:** 
 Use system DMVs (e.g., `sys.dm_exec_requests`, `sys.dm_exec_query_plan`) to track performance and diagnose issues.
- **Expected Impact:** **Small** (but essential for ongoing tuning)

---

## Final Summary

For **query-specific changes**, focus first on using materialized views and eliminating non-SARGable operations to reduce full scans and heavy computation. Then, optimize subqueries with CTEs, review join types, and use NOLOCK hints and precomputed columns to streamline the query further.

For **general changes**, improve your overall environment by optimizing data distribution/partitioning, adopting incremental loading, leveraging result caching, and maintaining healthy indexes/statistics. Rewriting expressions for SARGability and implementing advanced monitoring complete the approach, ensuring that queries run faster, cheaper, and more reliably.
