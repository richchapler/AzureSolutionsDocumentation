Microsoft Fabric provides two data stores: Data Warehouse and Lakehouse. The choice between the two depends on your specific needs and circumstances 12.

If you’re dealing with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and have developers skilled in Spark, a Lakehouse may be the best choice. On the other hand, if you’re primarily dealing with structured data and your developers are more comfortable with SQL, a Warehouse might be more suitable 2.

* Add On-Prem Data Gateway... https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install
  * Download and install gateway
  * The name Gateway Cluster is misleading... you might add more On-Prem Data Gateways to the "cluster", but the "cluster" is created when you create the first on-prem data gateway (and can be used at that point)

_Creating a Fabric pipeline with a connection to an on-prem SQL Server as a source involves several steps. However, as of now, the pipeline copy on-prem access (by SHIR in ADF) is not available yet1. You can refer to Differences between Data Factory in Fabric and Azure to get an idea on what are there and what are not_
